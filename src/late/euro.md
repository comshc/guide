# 14th Century Europe

## Social & Economic Upheaval (100 Years War)

### The Hundred Years War

There were several causes for this war:
1. **Flanders**: The French king (Philip IV) wanted to control Flanders, which was rich due to the wool trade. The English king (Edward I) wanted to control Flanders, too, as it was a major market for English wool.
2. **Gascony**: The English king was also the Duke of Gascony, a region in France under English control since 1259. Philip VI of France seized it in 1337, which caused the English Edward III to attack the French in Flanders.

The war was eventually won by the French, despite early English victories. But eventually, it led to economic shrinkage and devastation in both France and England. The war's effects lead to bankruptcy, changes in warfare tactics (with the introduction of cannons), and a shift towards mercenary armies. 

Literature about knights such as the Book of the Courtier, and Don Quixote, was written during this time.

### Economic Shrinkage

- There was an economic shrinkage in the late middle ages, although it was gradual and uneven throughout Europe. 
- There was also a shift to a colder/rainier climate that impacted agricultural production negatively. 
- Decreased food => decreased population => decreased demand for goods => decreased production
- In Florence, textiles, international trade, and banking kept the economy afloat.
- In England, the wool trade was the main source of income.
- The security of bankers varied, however the Medici family rose to power.



## Religious Upheaval

### King Philip vs Pope Boniface VIII

- King Philip IV of France wanted to tax the clergy, but Pope Boniface VIII refused. Philip also confiscated the treasury of the Order of Templars and stole money from the Jews.
- Boniface releases the Clericos Laicos which states that kings must have approval from the Papcy before they tax clergy. 
- Philip responds by doing a gold/silver embargo on the Papacy, and Boniface is forced to withdraw the Clericos Laicos.
- In the early 14th century, Philip pisses off Boniface multiple times, and Boniface responds everytime with a new papal bull.
- Philip sent troops to arrest the Pope, who was later released.
- Boniface gets arrested once more, but he flees to Rome, and dies of a stroke.
