# 14th Century Europe

## Social & Economic Upheaval (100 Years War)

### The Hundred Years War

There were several causes for this war:
1. **Flanders**: The French king (Philip IV) wanted to control Flanders, which was rich due to the wool trade. The English king (Edward I) wanted to control Flanders, too, as it was a major market for English wool.
2. **Gascony**: The English king was also the Duke of Gascony, a region in France under English control since 1259. Philip VI of France seized it in 1337, which caused the English Edward III to attack the French in Flanders.

The war was eventually won by the French, despite early English victories. But eventually, it led to economic shrinkage and devastation in both France and England. The war's effects lead to bankruptcy, changes in warfare tactics (with the introduction of cannons), and a shift towards mercenary armies. 

Literature about knights such as the Book of the Courtier, and Don Quixote, was written during this time.

### Economic Shrinkage

- There was an economic shrinkage in the late middle ages, although it was gradual and uneven throughout Europe. 
- There was also a shift to a colder/rainier climate that impacted agricultural production negatively. 
- Decreased food => decreased population => decreased demand for goods => decreased production
- In Florence, textiles, international trade, and banking kept the economy afloat.
- In England, the wool trade was the main source of income.
- The security of bankers varied, however the Medici family rose to power.



## Religious Upheaval

### King Philip vs Pope Boniface VIII

- King Philip IV of France wanted to tax the clergy, but Pope Boniface VIII refused. Philip also confiscated the treasury of the Order of Templars and stole money from the Jews.
- Boniface releases the Clericos Laicos which states that kings must have approval from the Papcy before they tax clergy. 
- Philip responds by doing a gold/silver embargo on the Papacy, and Boniface is forced to withdraw the Clericos Laicos.
- In the early 14th century, Philip pisses off Boniface multiple times, and Boniface responds everytime with a new papal bull.
- Philip sent troops to arrest the Pope, who was later released.
- Boniface gets arrested once more, but he flees to Rome, and dies of a stroke.


### Avignon Papacy

- Benedict XI (the successor of Boniface) tried to repair relations with Philip, but he died instead. 
- In 1309, he moved the papal court to Avignon, in Southern France. It stayed there until 1377.
- The Avignon Papacy was a period of corruption and scandal, with the papacy being controlled by the French monarchy (kind of).
- The papacy was also very good at collecting taxes (the IRS???????)
- Pople Gregory XI moved the papacy back to Rome in 1377, but then he died (the conclusion is obvious: Rome = Death).
- The College of the Cardinals elected their own pope, called Urban.
- Meanwhile, the French elected their own pope, called Clement.
- The Great Schism of 1378-1417 followed, with two popes being elected, one in Rome and one in Avignon.
- The Schism was resolved when the Coucil of Pisa elected a new pope to depose the previous 2 popes, but instead, they just accidentally elected a third pope.
- Fortunately, the Council of Constance in 1414 met for 4 years and deposed all the popes, with Martin V being elected as the new pope.

### Significance
- The Avignon Papacy and the Great Schism weakened the papacy and the church's authority.
- Seperated the church from the people, and the church from the state.
- Mysticism and heresy became more popular.

## Black Plague

### Causes
- (Probably) came from the east via trade routes
- Unsanitary conditions in cities attracted more rates, which carried the fleas that carried the plague.

### Effects
- Since cities were more affected, scholars, clergy, doctors, merchants, etc. were all terminated, including many of the highly educated people.
- 1/3 of the population of Europe died.
- The economy was devastated, and the price of labor increased.
- Closely related to the rise of the Renaissance and Capitalism.

### Sources

- We know so much about the plague because of the Decameron, written by Boccaccio in 1353. It's a collection of 100 stories told by 10 people who fled Florence during the plague.
- The title means "10 days" which is a play on Hexameron, a 6-day creation story in the Bible.
