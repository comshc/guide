(pg. 308-310)

- Claims that painting alone can portray all the visible works of nature
- Painting is able to communicate through language barriers
- Sculpturers are dirty and covered in dust, while painters are clean and can work in the comfort of their own homes using their brain. Therefore, obviously, painting > sculpting
- You need a brain to be good at painting
- Young people should learn perspective, then proportions
- practice a bit
- If you suck at painting, well, cope harder
- If you are good at painting, you will benifit by despising defects
- If you are good at painting, you can invent scenes and figures
