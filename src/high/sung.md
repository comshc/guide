## Social Structure
- Previously, the government was exclusively composed of the Imperial family and Scholarly-Elite. The Scholarly Elite were the only ones allowed to take the exam, and thus the only ones allowed to hold government positions.
- In the Song Dynasty, as cities developed merchants and craftsmen began to form a growing middle class. 
- Song Military was pretty much nonexistant (on purpose for fear of coups)

The government itself took the following structure:
1. The Emperor
2. His advisors, censors, imperial spokespeople, larger ministries.
3. Chancellery, Imperial secretaries, smaller ministries.
4. The Middle Class, though not technically allowed to take the exam, often tutored their children and bribed the government to gain positions. 
5. The Urban Poor was formed when peasants from the countryside fled rural poverty; they were often employed for hard and cheap labor by guilds who made humanitarian efforts to pay them. Many also worked in households of the rich, turned to prostitution or the organized crime guild.

## Religion
- Overall, the religious structure was very fluid. 
- People could practice any amount of religions, and often did.
- Confucianism was the most popular, and was the basis of the government.
- Government officials were expected to be Confucian, and the exams were based on Confucian texts.
- Buddhism mixed with many Confucian beliefs to form a new religion entirely.
- Local gods and deities were also worshipped.
- **All religions required complex ceremonies of burial and holidays to avoid evil spirits.**

## Song Life
- The Confucian extended family was still the heart of life. Appropriate respect to different relatives was expected. Birth was special as it allowed the family to carry on their lineage and ancestral cult; if one had no children to worship them they could become a ghost without the ability to be reborn.
- Housing was similar to the modern day: homeless were present but monasteries and military barracks often opened their doors, and the other urban poor were forced into cramped apartments. 
- Rich elite lived in manors which incorporated natural elements, as to align with religious traditions.
- Medicine was advanced, though not as advanced as that of the Islamic world. 
- Incorporation of religious doctrines was common.
- Clubs for specific interests (I.E. Exotic Foods Club) became popular, and there were so many brothels and tea houses it seems Hongzhou was the most developed city of the era.


## Song Art / Literature
- First mostly Scholarly Elite.
- The rise of printing (and subsequent explosion of book publishing) allows the middle class to become involved in the art world / the production of literature.
- Painting also becomes more popular, and it often shows scenes from Buddhist and Taoist canon, though in a minimalist manner to align with the religionsâ€™ ideas.
