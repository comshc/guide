# Crusades

## First Crusade

This was the only truly successful crusade, and began when the emperor of
Byzantium (Alexius Comnenus) sent a plea for help to the Pope (Urban II), about
some atrocities committed against the Christians by the Seljuk Turks. The Pope
made some speech in France, which convinced a bunch of knights and nobles to
join the crusade. They set off in `1096`, in hope of taking the Holy Land from
the Muslims. Between `1096-1099`, they were able to take many important cities,
and set up a feudal kingdom called the `Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem`.

## People's Crusade

At the same time as the "official" crusade, sanctioned by the Pope, there was
the so-called "People's Crusade". Comprised mainly of untrained peasants, it
lasted about 6 months. Instead of taking the Holy Land, they got distracted and
murdered a bunch of Jews.

#### A Certain Celt

- Sourcebook, page 135
- Christian account of the People's Crusade

This source follows a Celtic guy named `Peter the Hermit`. He suffered
"ill-treatment" at the hands of the Turks while doing some pilgrimage, which
inspired him to lead a crusade. He preached well, and was able to attract a
large following. They were all kinds of people, men, woman, and children. There
were some locusts, too, which they interpreted as that they'd "bring dreadful
affliction" on the Arabs.

#### At This Time

- Sourcebook, page 136
- Jewish account of the People's Crusade

This source is from the perspective of a Jewish individual in the Rhineland.
It views the crusaders quite poorly, as a barbaric and arrogant people. It
describes their attire as decorated with "a profane symbol â€” a horizontal line
over a vertical one." The masses of crusader peasants are referred to as
locusts:

> Their ranks swelled until the number of men, women, and children exceeded a
> locust horde covering the earth; of them it was said: "The locusts have no
> king."

They killed Jews whenever they came across them, as they believed they'd killed
Jesus and were at the same level as the Muslims.
