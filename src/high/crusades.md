# Crusades

## First Crusade

This was the only truly successful crusade, and began when the emperor of
Byzantium (Alexius Comnenus) sent a plea for help to the Pope (Urban II), about
some atrocities committed against the Christians by the Seljuk Turks. The Pope
made some speech in France, which convinced a bunch of knights and nobles to
join the crusade. They set off in `1096`, in hope of taking the Holy Land from
the Muslims. Between `1096-1099`, they were able to take many important cities,
and set up a feudal kingdom called the `Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem`.

## People's Crusade

At the same time as the "official" crusade, sanctioned by the Pope, there was
the so-called "People's Crusade". Comprised mainly of untrained peasants, it
lasted about 6 months. Instead of taking the Holy Land, they got distracted and
murdered a bunch of Jews.

## Primary Sources

### Primary Source: Christian/Jewish/Muslim Accounts of the First Crusade

(pg. 136-137)

#### Christian Account
- A celt called Peter `Peter the Hermit` left to worship Holy Sepulchre after suffering bad treatment from the Turks and Saracens
- He decided to preach to the Latin countries and gathered a large following
- He inspired the people to bear arms and ride horses
- A bunch of people followed him, forming the Celtic army
- Dressed in weird ways and used a profile picture of a horizontal line over a vertical one
- They first come across the Jews, who they kill because they killed Jesus
- In 1095, Pope Urban II saw Christianity getting absolutely violated, both in Europe and Asia
- Calls for a ouncil in Clermont, where he preaches about the atrocities committed against the Christians
- He calls on people to crusade to help "expel that wicked race from our Christian lands"

#### Muslim Account
- The Franks attack terrortories of the Muslims and take Toledo in 1085
- Sicily is taken in 1091
- Syria is attacked in 1097
- Baldwin, related to Roger the Frank, assembled an army to conquer the African Coast
- Roger the Frank's companions are excited about this proposal
- Roger then lets out a massive fart, and decides that the crusade is economically backwards
- He thinks that they should take Africa when they are strong enough
- Advises Baldwin to free Jerusalem, so Baldwin goes to attack Syria (hes an actual savant wtf)

#### Jewish Account

This source is from the perspective of a Jewish individual in the Rhineland.
It views the crusaders quite poorly, as a barbaric and arrogant people. It
describes their attire as decorated with "a profane symbol â€” a horizontal line
over a vertical one." The masses of crusader peasants are referred to as
locusts:

> Their ranks swelled until the number of men, women, and children exceeded a
> locust horde covering the earth; of them it was said: "The locusts have no
> king."

They killed Jews whenever they came across them, as they believed they'd killed
Jesus and were at the same level as the Muslims.
