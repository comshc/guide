# Crusades

## First Crusade

This was the only truly successful crusade, and began when the emperor of
Byzantium (Alexius Comnenus) sent a plea for help to the Pope (Urban II), about
some atrocities committed against the Christians by the Seljuk Turks. The Pope
made a moving speech in France, which convinced many knights and nobles to join
the crusade. They set off in `1096`, in hope of taking the Holy Land from the
Muslims. Between `1096-1099`, they were able to take many important cities, and
set up a feudal kingdom called the `Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem`.
