# Empire of Mali

Because they built little from stone and didn't have written language, there
exists little archaeological evidence for much of African history. However,
there is a strong oral tradition. The founding myth of Mali centers around this
guy Sundiata conquering a bunch of neighboring nations, which is something the
Empire of Mali was quite adept at. The Empire also became predominantly Muslim,
and its cities of Timbuktu and Djenn√© became famous centers of learning. They
also obtained obscene riches.

In 1307, this guy named `Kankan Musa` inherited the throne of Mali. He was a
devout Muslim, and made a pilgrimage to Mecca in `1324`. While there, a guy
named Shihab al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Fadlallah al-Umari (`al-Omari`)'s
friend saw Mr. Musa in Cairo.
