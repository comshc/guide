# Empire of Mali

Because they built little from stone and didn't have written language, there
exists little archaeological evidence for much of African history. However,
there is a strong oral tradition. The founding myth of Mali centers around this
guy Sundiata conquering a bunch of neighboring nations, which is something the
Empire of Mali was quite adept at. The Empire also became predominantly Muslim,
and its cities of Timbuktu and Djenn√© became famous centers of learning. They
also obtained obscene riches.

In 1307, this guy named `Kankan Musa` inherited the throne of Mali. He was a
devout Muslim, and made a pilgrimage to Mecca in `1324`. While there, a guy
named *Shihab al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Fadlallah al-Umari* (`al-Omari`)'s
friend saw Mr. Musa in Cairo.

This Kankan fellow spoke only through a translator, though he could speak
perfect Arabic. He had with him a whole bunch of gold, which he distributed too
much, causing the price of gold to crash and fucking up their economy.
al-Omari's friend tells him he should go visit the Sultan of Egypt. He
initially refuses, as he doesn't want to kiss the ground before the Sultan as
is required. So, instead, he kisses the ground before Allah, satisfying the
Sultan while still maintaining his dignity.
