# Africa in Antiquity

## Geography

Geography is very important in African history. The Sahara desert creates a
barrier separating the Mediterranean world from sub-Saharan Africa, with the
Nile allowing for travel and agriculture.

## Egypt

Egyptian history spans 3,000 years, and is divided into 32 dynasties. By 3rd
dynasty, Egypt was a unified state. The Old Kingdom was the period from
2,700-2,00 BC, where the pyramids were built and the pharaohs held absolute
power. Over time, the nobility gained power and the First Intermediate Period
began. By 2,050 BC, royal power was reestablished in the Middle Kingdom.
However, it was not as strong as the Old Kingdom, and the nobility took power
once more by 1,800 BC. This was the Second Intermediate Period. Around 1,700
BC, some people from Palestine called the Hyksos invaded Egypt and held it for
a century or two. In 1,570 BC, they were expelled and the New Kingdom was
created. This kingdom was much stronger than the Middle Kingdom before it, and
was a militaristic state in response to previous invasion. The power of the New
Kingdom began to decline, however, and they were part of Alexander's and Rome's
empires in the 4th and 1st centuries BC respectively.

### Egypt & Africa

Egypt conducted extensive trade and warfare with the Southern Nile region. By
